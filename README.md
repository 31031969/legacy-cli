The **SymfonyCloud (PHP) CLI** is an unofficial command-line interface for [SymfonyCloud](https://symfony.cloud). Use this tool to interact with your projects and to build them locally for development purposes.

## Requirements

* Operating system: Linux, OS X, or Windows 10
* PHP 5.5.9 or higher, with the following extensions: `curl`, `json`,
 `mbstring`, `pcre`, and `phar`. The installation command will check for these.
* Git
* A Bash-like shell:
  * On OS X or Linux/Unix: SH, Bash, Dash or ZSH - usually the built-in shell will work.
  * On Windows: [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/about) (recommended), or another Bash-compatible shell such as [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), Cygwin, or MinGW.
    The built-in Command Prompt may also work for most purposes.
* For building locally, your project's dependencies, e.g. Composer
